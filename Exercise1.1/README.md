**Overview:**  
In this exercise, I set up my local Python development environment and created the structure I’ll use throughout the course.

**Key Tasks Completed:**

- Set up virtual environments with virtualenvwrapper
- Created and activated a base environment (cf-python-base)
- Installed essential packages, including IPython
- Wrote a simple script (add.py) to practice user input and running Python files
- Generated a requirements.txt file using pip freeze
- Created a second environment (cf-python-copy) and installed packages from the requirements file to duplicate the original environment
- learned how to export installed packages to a requirements.txt file using "pip freeze > requirments.txt"


**Files Included:**
