## ✅ Exercise 1.2 — Data types in Python (Recipes)

## Overview

This exercise introduced me to organizing data in Python using dictionaries and lists by building a small recipe-based data model in an IPython shell.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- Dictionaries and lists  
- Nested data structures  
- Iteration and value access  

## What I Built / Did

- Created individual recipe structures using dictionaries  
- Stored multiple recipes inside a list called `all_recipes`  
- Printed ingredient lists for each recipe using loops  

## Data Structures Used (and Why)

**Dictionary (for each recipe):**  
Dictionaries allow related data (name, cooking time, ingredients) to be grouped together with clear labels, making the data easy to read and access later.

**List (for all recipes):**  
A list is ideal for storing multiple recipes in sequence and makes it easy to loop through them as the project grows.

## Reflection

This exercise helped reinforce how Python’s core data structures work together. Dictionaries make it easy to group related data, while lists make it simple to scale and organize collections of objects. By building and printing recipe structures, I practiced accessing nested values and have a better understanding of how Python stores and manipulates structured data.
