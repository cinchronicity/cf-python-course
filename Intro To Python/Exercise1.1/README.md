## Exercise 1.1 — [Python Environment Setup]

## Overview

In this exercise, I set up my local Python development environment and created the workflow I’ll use throughout the course.

## Key Concepts Practiced

- Python installation and environment management  
- Virtual environments  
- Package installation and dependency management  

## What I Built / Did

- Installed Python using Homebrew  
- Set up virtual environments with `virtualenvwrapper`  
- Created and activated a base environment (`cf-python-base`)  
- Installed essential packages, including IPython  
- Wrote a simple script (`add.py`) to practice user input and running Python files  
- Exported installed packages using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`  
- Created a second environment (`cf-python-copy`) and installed packages from the requirements file to duplicate the environment  

## Files Included

- `add.py`  
- `requirements.txt`  
- `cindy-learning-journal.docx`  

## Reflection

This exercise helped me understand how Python environments work and why isolating dependencies is important. Having a clean setup makes it easier to experiment, debug, and reproduce projects across different systems.
