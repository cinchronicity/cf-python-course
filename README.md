## Exercise 1.1 — Python Environment Setup

In this exercise, I installed Python using Homebrew, set up virtual environments with `virtualenvwrapper`, and practiced managing packages inside isolated environments. I installed useful tools like IPython, created a simple script (`add.py`), and learned how to export and reuse a requirements file. These steps established the workflow I will use throughout the course. Full details and screenshots are in the [Exercise 1.1](Intro%20To%20Python/Exercise1.1/) folder.

## Exercise 1.2 — Working With Data Structures (Recipes)

In this exercise, I practiced building structured data using Python dictionaries and lists. I created five recipe objects, stored them inside an outer list, and printed the ingredients for each recipe inside an IPython shell. I also explained why dictionaries are a good fit for recipe data and why a list works well for managing multiple recipes. Screenshots and full notes are included in the [Exercise 1.2](Intro%20To%20Python/Exercise1.2/) folder.

## Exercise 1.3 — Operators and Functions in Python

In this exercise, I created a Python script (`Exercise_1.3.py`) that prompts the user to enter any number of recipes, stores them in a list of dictionaries, and collects a master list of unique ingredients. The program calculates each recipe’s difficulty level using conditional logic and prints the recipe details in an organized format. It also prints all ingredients alphabetically at the end. Full details and screenshots are in the [Exercise 1.3](Intro%20To%20Python/Exercise1.3/) folder.
