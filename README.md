## Exercise 1.1 — [Python Environment Setup]

In this exercise, I installed Python using Homebrew, set up virtual environments with `virtualenvwrapper`, and practiced managing packages inside isolated environments. I installed useful tools like IPython, created a simple script (`add.py`), and learned how to export and reuse a requirements file. These steps established the workflow I will use throughout the course. Full details and screenshots are in the Exercise 1.1 folder.


## Exercise 1.2 — [Working With Data Structures] (Recipes)

In this exercise, I practiced building structured data using Python dictionaries and lists. I created five recipe objects, stored them inside an outer list, and printed the ingredients for each recipe inside an IPython shell. I also explained why dictionaries are a good fit for recipe data and why a list works well for managing multiple recipes. Screenshots and full notes are included in the Exercise 1.2 folder.
